# Trie-Data-Structure
I used tkinter for GUI and PyPDF2 for PDF manipulation. It allows users to open a PDF file, extract its content, display it in a text box, and implement a trie data structure for efficient word searching. The program also includes options to find and highlight words in the displayed text and clear the text box.
